  <span > Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer in Depression-era Alabama, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his children against prejudice.  </span>
                          <span > Small-town Alabama, 1932. Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and a widower. He has two young children, Jem and Scout. Atticus Finch is currently defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. Meanwhile, Jem and Scout are intrigued by their neighbours, the Radleys, and the mysterious, seldom-seen Boo Radley in particular. -grantss.  </span>
                          <span > Against the backdrop of the Great Depression, and with America struggling to find its feet, the widowed father and fiercely principled lawyer, Atticus Finch, is left all alone to care for his two children: Jem and Scout. When the young black worker, Tom Robinson, is wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting Mayella Ewell, a white woman living in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama, Atticus decides to take his case and defend him in court, turning his fellow townspeople against him. Suddenly, Atticus and his young children find themselves targeted by the local community, which seems unable to forgive and forget. But, this is a matter of justice and not the colour of one's skin. Will impartiality and reason prevail? -Nick Riganas.  </span>

<span class="additional-information" > Atticus Finch is an idealistic lawyer in the fictional town of Maycomb, a racially divided Alabama town, set in the early 1930s. Finch agrees to defend a young black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Many of the townspeople try to get Atticus to pull out of the trial, but he decides to go ahead. As one begins observing the reasons that make his defense far from easy, it becomes evident the reason lies in that no one in this town seems willing to believe in the innocence of an accused Negro. How will the trial turn out - and will it effect any changes in racial attitudes in Maycomb? -Brian Daly .  </span>
    <span class="additional-information" > Through the eyes of "Scout," a feisty six-year-old tomboy, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD carries us on an odyssey through the fires of prejudice and injustice in 1932 Maycomb, Alabama. Peopled with a cast of eccentrics, the tired and sleepy town finds itself as the venue of the trial of Tom Robinson, a young black man falsely accused of raping an ignorant white woman. Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem's widowed father and deeply principled man, is appointed to defend Tom for whom a guilty verdict from an all-white jury is a foregone conclusion. -Mark Fleetwood .  </span>
