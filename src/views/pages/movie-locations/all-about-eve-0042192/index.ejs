  <span > A seemingly timid but secretly ruthless ingénue insinuates herself into the lives of an aging Broadway star and her circle of theater friends.  </span>
                          <span > Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is waiting backstage to meet her idol, talented but aging Broadway star Margo Channing (Bette Davis). It seems innocent enough as Eve explains that she has seen Margo in EVERY performance of her current play. Margo and her friends take Eve under their wing but only theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) sees through Eve's evil plan, which is to take Margo's parts and her fiancé, Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill) too.  </span>
                          <span > Backstage story revolving around aspiring actress Eve Harrington. Tattered and forlorn, Eve shows up in the dressing room of Broadway mega-star Margo Channing and tells Margo and her friends a melancholy life story. Margo takes Eve under her wing, only to have Eve use her and connive against her. -Jwelch5742.  </span>

<span class="additional-information" > Aspiring actress Eve Harrington maneuvers her way into the lives of Broadway star Margo Channing, playwright Lloyd Richards, and director Bill Simpson. This classic story of ambition and betrayal has become part of American folklore. Bette Davis claims to have based her character on the persona of film actress Tallulah Bankhead. Davis' line "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night" is legendary, but all of the film's dialogue sparkles with equal brilliance. -Jeanne Baker .  </span>
    <span class="additional-information" > The ambitious Eve Harrington gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing and her friends Karen Richards and her playwright husband Lloyd Richards, her director boyfriend Bill Simpson, and producer Max Fabian. Everybody except cynical critic Addison DeWitt believes that Eve is simply a naïve, obsessed Margo fan and they try to help her. Actually, Eve is a cynical, manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her show- business goals. -Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  </span>
    <span class="additional-information" > Stage star Margo Channing is friend to playwright Lloyd Richards and his wife Karen, in love with director Bill Simpson, and the idol of Eve Harrington. When Eve becomes Margo's secretary-aide, she starts to dominate, sending Bill Margo's birthday wishes and arranging a party for him, at which Margo explodes. Eve becomes Margo's understudy and when Margo misses a performance, critic Addison DeWitt gives Eve rave reviews while making acerbic remarks about aging actresses like Margo. At Margo and Bill's engagement party Eve tries to force Karen to get her the lead in Lloyd's new play. Margo tells Lloyd she is going to retire. Eve gets the part but Addison announces to her that he knows the lies and schemes she used to get where she is. -Ed Stephan .  </span>
