After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois meets his dearest friends Jo and the Italian Mario Ferrati, who invite Tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous Mappin and Webb Ltd, but he declines. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado, who became the lover of Louis Grutter, gangster owner of the L' Âge d' Or nightclub, and he humiliates and beats her for being unfaithful. Then he calls Jo and Mario and proposes a burglary of the safe of the jewelry. They invite the Italian specialist in safes and elegant wolf Cesar to join their team and they plot a perfect heist. They are successful in their plan, but the Don Juan Cesar errs by giving ... </span>

Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Fresh out of jail after a hard five-year imprisonment, weary master burglar Tony le Stéphanois returns to a rain-soaked Paris to discover that his girl Mado is now the mistress of a rival dope-dealing gangster. Utterly disheartened, Tony reluctantly accepts the proposition of his young protégé Jo the Swede and his friend Mari, for a quick smash-and-grab raid on the prestigious jewelry store Mappin and Webb, on one condition: to step up this job into an all-out jewel heist. With an impeccable plan and the aid of the expert safe-cracker Cesar the Milanese, the band of thieves stands a great chance of succeeding--but what if opening the jewelry shop's impregnable safe is the robbery's easiest part? Nick Riganas In Paris, Tony (nicknamed Le Stéphanois after his hometown Saint-Étienne) has just been released from prison after five years, time served for a jewel heist. He did not give up his younger friend and associate Jo--Le Suedois (The Swede)--in loyalty and to give Jo a chance at life, which now includes a wife, Louise, and their five-year-old son Tonio, named after Tony. The first of Tony's tasks is to get back at some people, including his old girlfriend Mado, who instead of waiting for him took up with gangster nightclub-owner Louis Grutter (Le Tatoué :The Tattoo). His second task is to find a way to earn money, as gambling won't cut it. His and Jo's friend Mario Ferrati, suggests something akin to a smash-and-grab of the three stones in the window of the high-end jewelry store Mappin and Webb. Initially declining the offer, Tony agrees only in making it a true heist to rob their safe instead, employing a fourth, top-end safe-cracker Cesar (Le Milanais: The Milanese). Tony has a plan all mapped out to conduct the heist in the middle of the night so they'll be done and out by 5AM to not arouse suspicion in neighboring businesses just opening for the day. The biggest issue with the plan is not tripping the temperamental alarm which can be set off by a power failure or excessive vibration. Even if they are able to get the jewels out of the safe and escape, they must still be careful to not bring attention to themselves until they can fence the goods and get the money. Even if all four are able to adhere to these strict post-heist rules, they cannot control their pasts catching up with them--especially Tony, who has the most potential problematic baggage.
