                          An in-depth examination of the ways in which the Vietnam War impacts and disrupts the lives of several friends in a small steel mill town in Pennsylvania. Michael, Steven and Nicky are 3 best friends who enjoy going deer hunting quite often. These men get enlisted to head to Vietnam to fight for their country and celebrate with a farewell party, as well as Steven marrying a pregnant woman named "Angela." After the horrors during the war and edge-grabbing games of Russian Roulette that these men are forced to play, Michael returns home and realizes that his deer hunting outings aren't the same as they used to be, because of the war and he eventually finds out that Steven is handicapped and Nicky hasn't returned from Vietnam, and in response, he heads back to Vietnam to rescue him.::Koen Versieck 1968. Michael, Nick and Steven are only three of a group of friends and coworkers at the local steel mill in their small town of Clairton, Pennsylvania - they and most of their community blue collar of Eastern European heritage - but they are the only three in the community who will imminently be heading off into combat in Vietnam. In the days before they leave, they will attend to a few items, Steven who will marry Angela in a lavish event for the entire community, and the male friends, without Steven, who will go deer hunting the following morning, a highly ritualized activity especially for Michael. Steven is not the only one who will leave behind a girl, Nick in a serious relationship with Linda, she wanting to escape the abuse inflicted on her by her alcoholic father. Besides Linda's, there are many issues underneath the otherwise happy and joyous surface of the community, that surface joy only ramped up with the wedding and everyone, including the three subjects, seeing Michael, Nick and Steven as the honor and duty of them all and of the country. The three will find that the community hopes of their time in Vietnam is not what they want, their Vietnam experience which will inextricably be tied to the way they deal with life, with those that head home, either wanting or able, unwilling or unable to express how the war has damaged them. The three may be the only ones to help the other(s) who didn't come out the other end in one piece, either physically or emotionally.::Huggo Michael, Steven and Nick are young factory workers from Pennsylvania who enlist into the Army to fight in Vietnam. Before they go, Steven marries the pregnant Angela, and their wedding party also serves as the men's farewell party. After some time and many horrors, the three friends fall in the hands of the Vietcong and are brought to a prison camp in which they are forced to play Russian roulette against each other. Michael makes it possible for them to escape, but they soon get separated again.::Leon Wolters <wolters@strw.LeidenUniv.nl> Michael, Nick, and Steven are three buddies from the steel mill town of Clairton, Penn.They work together, hang out in a local bar and enjoying weekends deer hunting Ina a larger group with three other friends. But their placid life is soon to be changed after the three buddies enlist in the airborne infantry to go to Vietnam. So they all celebrate a goodbye at Steven's wedding and they leave for Vietnam. They are captured by the enemy and forced to play games of Russian Roulette to amuse their guards. They escape and Mike returns home to find Nick has stayed in Vietnam and Steven is handicapped after losing his legs and the use of one arm after the escape. Mike finds that deer hunting has changed for him after Vietnam and he returns to Vietnam during the fall to attempt to rescue Nick.::Jasper Yangchareon
