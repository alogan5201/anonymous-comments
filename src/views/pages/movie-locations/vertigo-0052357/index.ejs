  <span > A former San Francisco police detective juggles wrestling with his personal demons and becoming obsessed with the hauntingly beautiful woman he has been hired to trail, who may be deeply disturbed.  </span>
                          <span > Following his early retirement as a detective from the San Francisco Police Department, John Ferguson - Scottie to his friends - becomes obsessed with two women in succession, those obsessions which trouble his long time friend and former fianc√©e, Midge Wood, a designer of women's undergarments. The first is wealthy and elegant platinum blonde Madeleine Elster, the wife of his college acquaintance Gavin Elster, who hires John to follow her in Gavin's belief that she may be a danger to herself in thinking that she has recently been possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, Madeleine's great-grandmother who she knows nothing about, but who Gavin knows committed suicide in being mentally unbalanced when she was twenty-six, Madeleine's current age. The second is Judy Barton, who John spots on the street one day. Judy is a working class girl, but what makes John obsessed with her is that, despite her working class style and her brunette hair, she is the spitting image of Madeleine, into who he tries to transform Judy. The initial question that John has is if there is some connection between Madeleine and Judy. What happens between John and individually with Madeleine and Judy is affected by the reason John took that early retirement: a recent workplace incident that showed that he is acrophobic which leads to a severe case of vertigo whenever he looks down from tall heights. -Huggo.  </span>
                          <span > Strange as it may sound, whenever former police detective John "Scottie" Ferguson looks down from a high place or even gets more than a few centimetres above the ground, he triggers an extreme, almost irrational fear of falling. Having all the time in the world to enjoy his early retirement, Scottie is reluctantly back in the game when Gavin Elster, an old acquaintance from college and shipowner magnate, enlists his help to shed light on the disturbing behaviour of Madeleine, his icy, remote wife. However, as the intrigued friend follows unsuspecting Madeleine's every move, more and more, a dangerous attraction teetering on the brink of obsession begins to form. Can Madeleine's mystery and John's fixation stand in the way of love? Above all, why do we crave what we can't have? -Nick Riganas.  </span>

<span class="additional-information" > John "Scottie" Ferguson is a retired San Francisco police detective who suffers from acrophobia, and Madeleine is the lady who leads him to high places. A wealthy shipbuilder who is an acquaintance from college days approaches Scottie and asks him to follow his beautiful wife, Madeleine. He fears she is going insane, maybe even contemplating suicide, as he believes she has been possessed by a dead ancestor who committed suicide. Scottie is skeptical, but agrees to the assignment after he sees the beautiful Madeleine. -filmfactsman.  </span>
